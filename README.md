# Compose Specification

This repository hosts the canonical specification for
Compose—a network of rollups that enjoys synchronous, atomic composability through the
shared publisher architecture.
Such a feature is achieved by two mechanisms:

- a simple two-phase commit protocol that provides coordination
on the inclusion of a cross-chain transaction.
- a synchronous settlement pipeline, which finalizes all chains
simultaneously in L1 with a single ZK proof.


## Reading Guide

To read about the protocol in detail, please check:

1. [Synchronous Composability Protocol (SCP)](./synchronous_composability_protocol.md):
the fundamental building block that provides coordination
on a single cross-chain transaction inclusion.
2. [Superblock Construction Protocol (SBCP)](./superblock_construction_protocol.md):
the orchestration layer that manages multiple SCP instances,
block construction, and defines the triggering and input for the settlement pipeline.
3. [Settlement Layer](./settlement_layer.md):
explains the settlement pipeline of Compose,
picturing the recursive ZK programs architecture which
outputs a single ZK proof about the state progress of the entire chain.

## Spec Library

This repo contains a [Rust implementation](./compose/) of the core protocol logic.

| Crate | Description |
|---|---|
| `compose-spec` | Core types: `ChainId`, `InstanceId`, `XtRequest`, etc. |
| `compose-spec-scp` | 2-phase commit protocol (publisher + sequencer instances) |
| `compose-spec-sbcp` | Superblock construction protocol (period/settlement management) |
| `compose-spec-proto` | Protobuf wire format (hand-written prost structs) |

### Build & Test

```bash
cd compose
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Or using Make:

```bash
make test
make lint
make verify
```

## Rollup Integration

Compose's proposed modules do not fully specify every layer of a rollup.
This is intentional: we provide minimal integrable modules,
so each rollup retains sovereignty over choices like data availability logic,
local transaction priority ordering, batching logic, and related pipeline details.
As a default, we use a modified [OP](https://docs.optimism.io/concepts/stack/getting-started) + [OP-Succinct](https://github.com/succinctlabs/op-succinct/tree/main) stack,
currently supporting the [Isthmus hard fork](https://docs.optimism.io/concepts/stack/network-upgrades).

Read our [tutorial](https://github.com/compose-network/contracts/blob/develop/L1-settlement/README.md) for more details on rollup migration.
