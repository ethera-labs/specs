Feature: Publisher Instance Scheduling
  The SP initiates multiple composability instances during a period.
  It should maintain a queue with incoming XTRequests from users
  (either sent directly from the user, or relayed by sequencers).
  It follows the constraint that no chain can participate in more than one
  active instance at the same time.
  Thus, parallel instances are allowed at the publisher level
  as long as their participant sets are disjoint.
  Moreover, each instance is assigned a sequence number that increases
  monotonically within a period, starting from 1.
  Once a new period starts, the sequence number resets to 1.
  When an instance is decided, its participant chains are freed
  and can be included in future instances.

  Background:
    Given the participating chains are "1,2,3,4"
    And SP is currently at period ID "20" targeting superblock "8"

  @publisher @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario: Starts an instance with valid XTRequest and starts from sequence number 1
    Given SP has not started any instance in period "20"
    And chains "1,2" are inactive
    When SP attempts to start an instance with XTRequest:
      """

    Then SP should create an instance with:
