Feature: Sequencer Instance Management
  Sequencers must stop processing local transactions once a composability instance starts.
  An instance can only be started by the sequencer if it has a current pending block.
  The new instance's period ID must match the period ID tagged on the pending block.
  Furthermore, sequence numbers for instances must increase strictly within the same period.
  Only one active instance is allowed per sequencer at any time.
  Once the current instance gets decided, local transactions can be processed again and new instances are allowed.
  An instance also ends when the sequencer itself sends Vote(0), which similarly unlocks local transactions.
  Users can submit an XTRequest to the sequencer, but the sequencer should only forward it to the SP and discard it.
  That is, only the SP is allowed to start new instances.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And the sequencer "A" is at period ID "20" targeting superblock "11"

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario: StartInstance is buffered until a pending block exists
    Given the sequencer "A" has no pending block
    When the sequencer "A" receives StartInstance for:
      | field           | value |
      | instance_id     | 0x1   |
      | period_id       | 20    |
      | sequence_number | 1     |
    Then the sequencer "A" should not start the instance yet
    And the sequencer "A" should not send a Vote to the SP
    And the StartInstance for instance "0x1" should be buffered
    When the sequencer "A" begins building a new block tagged with period "20"
    Then the sequencer "A" should process the buffered StartInstance for instance "0x1"
    And the sequencer "A" should start the instance, register a snapshot of its state root, and lock local transactions

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @error
  Scenario Outline: Period id mismatch for instance and pending block results in rejection
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period <block_period>
    When the sequencer "A" receives StartInstance for:
      | field           | value             |
      | instance_id     | 0x1               |
      | period_id       | <instance_period> |
      | sequence_number | 1                 |
    Then the sequencer "A" should reject the instance by sending a vote "false" to the SP

    Examples:
      | block_period | instance_period |
      | 20           | 19              |
      | 20           | 21              |

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @error
  Scenario Outline: Old or repeated sequence numbers result in rejection
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the last accepted sequence number for period "20" is "<last_sequence>"
    When the sequencer "A" receives StartInstance for:
      | field           | value               |
      | instance_id     | 0x1                 |
      | period_id       | 20                  |
      | sequence_number | <incoming_sequence> |
    Then the sequencer "A" should reject the instance by sending a vote "false" to the SP

    Examples:
      | last_sequence | incoming_sequence |
      | 3             | 2                 |
      | 5             | 5                 |

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @error
  Scenario: Ongoing instance makes the sequencer reject new StartInstance requests
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the last accepted sequence number for period "20" is "3"
    And the sequencer "A" has an active instance
    When the sequencer "A" receives StartInstance for:
      | field           | value |
      | instance_id     | 0x2   |
      | period_id       | 20    |
      | sequence_number | 4     |
    Then the sequencer "A" should reject the instance by sending a vote "false" to the SP

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario: Successful StartInstance locks local transactions
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has no active instance
    When the sequencer "A" receives StartInstance for:
      | field           | value |
      | instance_id     | 0x1   |
      | period_id       | 20    |
      | sequence_number | 4     |
    Then the sequencer "A" should start the instance, register a snapshot of its state root, and lock local transactions

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario: Decided instance unlocks local transactions
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has an active instance "0x1"
    When the sequencer "A" receives Decided for instance "0x1"
    Then the sequencer "A" should unlock and process local transactions
    And the sequencer "A" should have no active instance

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario Outline: Either Decided value ends the active instance and unlocks local transactions
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has an active instance "0x1"
    And the sequencer "A" previously voted true for instance "0x1"
    When the sequencer "A" receives Decided for instance "0x1" with decision "<decision>"
    Then the sequencer "A" should unlock and process local transactions
    And the sequencer "A" should have no active instance

    Examples:
      | decision |
      | true     |
      | false    |

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @happy-path
  Scenario: Sending Vote(0) ends the active instance and unlocks local transactions
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has an active instance "0x1"
    When the sequencer "A" sends Vote "false" for instance "0x1" to the SP
    Then the sequencer "A" should unlock and process local transactions
    And the sequencer "A" should have no active instance

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @error
  Scenario: Decided event for a different instance is rejected
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has an active instance "0x1"
    When the sequencer "A" receives Decided for instance "0x2"
    Then the attempt should fail with error:
      """
      mismatched active instance ID
      """

  @sequencer @sbcp @instances @error
  Scenario: Decided message with no active instance is rejected
    Given the sequencer "A" has a pending block tagged with period "20"
    And the sequencer "A" has no active instance
    When the sequencer "A" receives Decided for instance "0x1"
    Then the attempt should fail with error:
      """
      no active instance
      """
