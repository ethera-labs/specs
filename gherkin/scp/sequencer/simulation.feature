Feature: Sequencer Simulation And Mailbox Population
  After instance start, the sequencer should immediately start the simulation process.
  The simulation should return a success or an error, as well as the written mailbox messages.
  Any new written mailbox message should be forwarded to the destination sequencer.
  In case the result is a success, the sequencer should vote true.
  In case the result is an error other than "Read miss", the sequencer should vote false.
  In case of a "Read miss" error, the sequencer should record such message header as expected and wait for it.
  Once a mailbox message from another sequencer is received via the network, the sequencer should add it to the list
  of pending messages.
  Once the header of a new pending message matches the header of an expected one,
  the sequencer should create a mailbox.putInbox transaction for it and insert it before the other transactions,
  and then restart the simulation.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And there is a chain "2" with sequencer "B"
