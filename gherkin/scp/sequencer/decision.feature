Feature: Sequencer Decision
  On the sequencer perspective, an instance terminates in two cases:
  - when it sends a rejection vote (either due simulation failure or timeout)
  - when it receives a decision from the SP
  If the instance is decided as rejected, the sequencer should not include its transactions in a block.
  Else, it should include the transactions along with the created mailbox.putInbox ones.
  Note that the shared publisher can only send a decision true if all sequencers have voted true.
  Thus, receiving a decision true without having voted true is an invalid protocol state.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And there is a chain "2" with sequencer "B"
