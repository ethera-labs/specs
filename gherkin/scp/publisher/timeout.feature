Feature: Publisher Timeout
  The shared publisher starts a local timer when it launches an SCP instance.
  If the timer expires before a decision is sent, it must reject the instance and notify
  every participant. Once a decision is broadcast, any subsequent timeout should be ignored.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And there is a chain "2" with sequencer "B"

  @publisher @scp @timeout @error
