Feature: Publisher Start Instance
  The shared publisher is responsible for launching every SCP instance.
  When an instance starts, it broadcasts the StartInstance message to each rollup that
  appears in the XTRequest and starts a local timeout for the decision phase.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And there is a chain "2" with sequencer "B"
    And there is a chain "3" with sequencer "C"
    And there is a chain "4" with sequencer "D"

  @publisher @scp @start-instance @happy-path
  Scenario: Broadcasts StartInstance to all participating sequencers
    When SP starts an instance:
      """
      instance_id: 0x1
      period_id: 7
      sequence_number: 3
      xtrequest:
        1: [tx1_1, tx1_2]
        2: [tx2]
        3: [tx3]
      """
    Then sequencers "A,B,C" should receive StartInstance:

    And a timer for instance "0x1" should start at the shared publisher

    When SP starts an instance:

    And sequencer "C" should not receive StartInstance for instance "0x2"
    And sequencer "D" should not receive StartInstance for instance "0x2"
    And a timer for instance "0x2" should start at the shared publisher
