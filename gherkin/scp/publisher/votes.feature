Feature: Publisher Vote Processing
  The shared publisher collects votes from the sequencers that were included in the XTRequest.
  It keeps one vote per chain, rejects invalid senders, and finalizes the instance once the
  voting rules are satisfied.

  Background:
    Given there is a chain "1" with sequencer "A"
    And there is a chain "2" with sequencer "B"
    And there is a chain "3" with sequencer "C"
